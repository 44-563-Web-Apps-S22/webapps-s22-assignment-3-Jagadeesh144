<h1>Disjoint Set Union</h1>
<p>make_set(v) - creates a new set consisting of the new element v
union_sets(a, b) - merges the two specified sets (the set in which the element a is located,
 and the set in which the element b is located)
find_set(v) - returns the representative (also called leader) of the set that contains the element v.
 This representative is an element of its corresponding set. It is selected in each set by the data structure itself 
 (and can change over time, namely after union_sets calls). This representative can be used to check if two elements are part of the same set or not. 
 a and b are exactly in the same set, if find_set(a) == find_set(b). Otherwise they are in different sets.
</p>
<pre>
void make_set(int v) {
    parent[v] = v;
}

int find_set(int v) {
    if (v == parent[v])
        return v;
    return find_set(parent[v]);
}

void union_sets(int a, int b) {
    a = find_set(a);
    b = find_set(b);
    if (a != b)
        parent[b] = a;
}
